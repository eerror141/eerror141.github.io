		<p style="padding-left:55px; padding-right:55px"; align="justify"> Previously, we noticed that the fraction of female characters in movie metadata is much smaller compared to the fraction of male characters. Even though there seems to be an increase of the fraction of female characters between the 70s and 2010, this fraction was still around 35% in 2010 which is far from parity.<br>
Therefore, we wished to analyze if this difference is also present in the movie summaries. Indeed, a character may be present in the list of all characters of a movie, however it does not mean that the character is also mentioned in the summary of the movie as it could just be the housekeeper which appears only once in the movie and is not important for the story. Indeed, one can assume that the characters mentioned in the summaries are quite important for the story and have a certain contribution to its development and especially the ones mentioned several times.<br>
As we can observe below, the fraction of mentions of characters in the summaries is around 35%. This value is very similar to the one computed in the CMU character metadata. Thus, it confirms that female characters are underrepresented and seem to have overall less importance compared to men. In addition, no statistically significant evolution has occurred between the 40s and 2010. In fact, the calculated fraction has remained relatively constant.

		<p style="padding-left:55px; padding-right:55px"; align="justify"> In order to analyze the activeness of the characters, we extracted all the verbs related to them and defined if the action was done by the character (active) or done to them (passive). At first glance of the graph, one might think that the men are more often described as doing things, e.g using the active voice. Indeed, the difference in activeness score among male and female characters is always positive through the years. However, the magnitude of this difference is very small (around 3-5%). 
Secondly, across the years, a decrease in activeness of male characters seems to appear. There is a statistical significant difference but its effect is very small, almost negligible.<br>
By only doing this naive analysis, one might think that our initial hypothesis is incorrect. Indeed, this value seems to indicate that women and men in movies are portrayed to do active actions equally. However, it is important to realize that not all actions are equivalent. For example the two following sentences are both in the active voice, but have completely different level of ‚Äúactiveness‚Äù for the associated characters:<br>
<em>‚ÄúSophie fell in love with him at first sight.‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúMark rushed to her rescue.‚Äù</em></p>
