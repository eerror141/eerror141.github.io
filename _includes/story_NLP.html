		<p style="padding-left:70px; padding-right:70px; padding-bottom:30px"; align="justify"> In order to determine how active the male and female characters are, we analyze the summaries with natural language processing. Here is an example of story that will be analyzed with the same process: <br> <br> <em> "Once upon a time, there lived a young prince called Flynn Rider. He was known by all to be kind, caring, and handsome. However, on one fateful day, his step-brother Cyrus consumed by jealousy decided to imprison him in a high tower far far away from the family kingdom. Research go on for weeks without success: the prince has vanished. Rapunzel, an ADAventurer from a small hamlet at the border of the kingdom, likes to explore the deep forests with her chameleon Pascal. On one of her wanders, she discovers the high tower where dear Flynn is kept captive. Sensing a human presence in the tower, Pascal rushed to the top where he encountered Flynn. The chameleon highly squeaked due to his surprise which worried Rapunzel who joined him at the top by using her long hair as a rope and saved Flynn. She then denounced Cyrus and his atrocious behaviour who is sentenced to jail."</em> </p>

		<p style="padding-left:55px; padding-right:55px"; align="justify"><br> Above are the tables containing the extracted active and passive verbs and the number of mentions of each character. Active and passive are defined by their grammatical tense. However, if a verb is extracted as active but figures in a list of descriptive verbs, as for example <em> she seems sad</em>, the verb is moved to the passive group. Next, the activeness score is computed by dividing the number of active verbs (after the potential shift of some verbs) by the total number of verbs extracted. <br>
			The first table is the result of the NLP process and the second one corresponds to what a human would extract. The NLP process first identifies the characters in the summary and then it counts the number of times each character or its references are mentioned and it extracts the verbs that are linked to it. We can observe that the two tables are almost identical, only a few verbs (indicated by colours) are different which assures that the extraction is well done by our algorithm. Additionally, one can see that the missing/misplaced verbs are mostly present in difficult sentences structures, which is tolerable. Using the same process, all the summaries of the selected movies will be processed.</p>
