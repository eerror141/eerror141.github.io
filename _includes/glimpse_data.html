		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;"; align="justify";> To investigate the portrayal of women in movies, we used the CMU movie summary corpus which contains movie summaries from Wikipedia and their metadata extracted from Freebase. For each movie, we will focus on its list of characters and its summary to explore this issue. </p>
		<h4 style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;";> <b>Data in numbers</b> </h4>

		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px; font-size:12px"; align="justify"> Source: [2] <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/pubs/pdf/bamman+oconnor+smith.acl13.pdf"> David Bamman and al., Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters, ACL 2013, Sofia, Bulgaria, (2013)  </a> </p>
		<h4 style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;padding-top: 30px;"; align="justify"> <b>Women are underrepresented in movies</b> </h4>
		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;"; align="justify"> We've seen that the large majority of movies include a higher fraction of male compared to female characters at least in the top grossing movies released in 2021. But, has it always been the case and is the trend changing? As we can observe on the graph, this inequality has always been present. Indeed, the fraction of female characters varies between 25% and 36%. Interestingly, we can see a slight increasing trend from the 80s coinciding with the slow improvement of women rights since the late 70s.</p>

		<h4 style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px"; align="justify";> <b> Is the underrepresentation of women the same for all movie genres? </b> <br> </h4>
		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;"; align="justify";> In this plot, we observe that the top 10 genres featuring female or male characters are different. We notice that some genres are shared such as drama, thriller and romantic comedy but others are completely absent for the other gender. Additionally, some of the genres are very stereotypical. For example, 4 out of 10 genres for female characters are related to romance or family whereas male characters are much more present in action and science fiction movies. </p>
		{% include top10genres_barplot.html %}
		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;"; align="justify";> Now that we know that the genres in which women are most featured in is different, let‚Äôs look at a few of the most common movies genres in the dataset and see if the fractions of male and female characters has evolved differently through time.</p>								   
		{% include diff_percentage.html %}								      
		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px"; align="justify";> 
		<ul style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px"; align="justify";>
			<li> As expected, in very stereotypical masculine movie genres such as Action/Adventure, the difference in fraction of male vs female characters is very large. Whereas, for a more stereotypically feminine movie genres, for example Romance or Musical films, the difference is smaller. Interestingly, it is still quite large, respectively about 15 and 24% . Indeed, one could expect that the fraction of women in movie genres, traditionally marketed to them, to be much higher than in more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù movies. Additionally, no significant evolution is observed.</li>
			<br>
			<li> Intriguingly, the difference in Horror film is relatively low compared to the other similar more violent movies genres. Nonetheless, this does not mean that women are more empowered in the Horror genre. Indeed, it is widely known that women are often the victim of atrocious violence in these movies. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Finally, it seems that some of the genres evolved and other not. For example, the fraction in Comedy movies do not change significantly over time while the one of Drama seems to slowly decrease since the 80s.</li> 
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px; padding-top: 30px"; align="justify";> In this initial exploratory analysis, we discovered that the fractions of female characters is much smaller than male and that it did not evolve a lot through time. So we were wondering, what are the typical roles and actions that female characters portray in movies? In order to research this question, we will analyze movie summaries by using natural language processing. </p>
